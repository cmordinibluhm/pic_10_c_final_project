## This readme.md file will serve as a journal for my final project

### April 10, 2018
	Today I looked at some old PIC 10C final projects on YouTube and had the idea to do a phase changing game. 

### Commit 1
	Today I went to Professor Salazar's office hours and asked some questions about the project and about my idea. 
	He recommended I keep a journal like this in my readme file. He also said not to worry about choosing a difficult 
	project and that it doesn't even have to work at the end. The main thing is the process I go through and how much 
	I learn. 
	
 	I have been practicing markdown a little, and so I'm writing this in markdown. 

	I also have a Google Doc with brainstorming about the final project.  
	
	I just learned to start nano with -m for mouse support. Sweet!

### Commit 2 and 3
	I talked to Stephanie last week and she gave me the idea of focusing on the physics. Her idea is basically to just do solid/liquid/gas solvers.
	Today I started digging into Qt following a YouTube tutorial from a former PIC 10C student.
    
        The "Playground" Qt project is the physics solid collision solver.
        The "Phase Changer" Qt project is the platformer game.

### Commit 4
        Updated .gitignore to ignore build- and .pro.user. Clearing index and re-adding everything that should be tracked.
