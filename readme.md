## This readme.md file will serve as a journal for my final project

### April 10, 2018
	Today I looked at some old PIC 10C final projects on YouTube and had the idea to do a phase changing game. 

### April 11, 2018
	Today I went to Professor Salazar's office hours and asked some questions about the project and about my idea. 
	He recommended I keep a journal like this in my readme file. He also said not to worry about choosing a difficult 
	project and that it doesn't even have to work at the end. The main thing is the process I go through and how much 
	I learn. 
	
 	I have been practicing markdown a little, and so I'm writing this in markdown. 

	I also have a Google Doc with brainstorming about the final project.  
	
	I just learned to start nano with -m for mouse support. Sweet!
